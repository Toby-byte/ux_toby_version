1. The recipes are not random, as requested, but hardcoded (Done)

2. The categories are hardcoded instead of read from the API (recipe_site.html, lines 43-58) (Done)

3. Lack of wayfinding mechanisms (CTAs, breadcrumbs) (Done)
- not possible with only json server since it can only serve endpoints as routes

4. Sitemap: no differentiation between main navigation, utility navigation and footer navigation (Done)
link to Sitemap: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPv32keYiOPsWgLrjX2zyIb4fWV6IIkikrDpsaAammc/edit?usp=sharing

5. Inline JavaScript (e.g, index.html, line 33), thus breaking the separation of concerns pattern 
(in other words, don't use onclick in HTML elements bc. of separation of concerns pattern) (Done)

6. Accessibility: "title" attributes missing in <a> (Done)

7. Inconsistent code indentation (Done)

8. Missing character entities (e.g., the "ø" in aboutus.html, lines 92 and 118) (Done)

9. Redundant font load in _variables.css (Done)

10. CSS: hardcoded colours (cards.css, lines 82, 83 and 84) and hardcoded fonts (search_styles.css, line 24) instead of custom properties (Done)

11. The homepage images are too big and with no alternate sizes (Done)
- this can be tested with devtools see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode under Set device pixel ratio
- use squoosh to make the pictures

12. Unnecessary use of DOMContentLoaded, as the JavaScript files are loaded with defer (Done)

13. JavaScript: Some URLs are hardcoded instead of declared as variables with const (Done)

                                ------------------  13 of 13 done  ------------------

Bonus: all JavaScript needs a refactor, to see if code can be improved
